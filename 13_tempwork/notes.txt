- Encountered an issue trying to access 'occupations.csv' 
    Given error: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'occupations.csv'
- Solved issue by concatenating its path to the file name
- Could not figure out how to iterate through a dictionary in Jinja2
    - Instead, found method of iterating through multiple lists in a single for loop in Jinja2 at "Discuss ERP Next" website
- Most notable line from egolessprogramming.pdf: 
    "Average people can be trained to accept their humanity—their inability to function like a machine—and to value it and 
    work with others so as to keep it under the kind of control needed if programming is to be successful."

Sadly, not feeling too flasky after struggling to find a way to iterate through a dictionary for over an hour. :(
