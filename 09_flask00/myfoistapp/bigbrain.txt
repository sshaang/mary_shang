Q0: This syntax seems to be similar to the syntax in Java where a variable is assigned to a creation of an instance of a datatype.
Ex: int var = (int)(Math.random())


Q1: The only point of reference we have is that in a user terminal, "$cd /" redirects to the root directory. (/)


Q2: This will print to the root directory (in the terminal). This will print the name of the function.


Q3: This will appear because a return statement in a function will output the return value.


Q4: These constructs seem to be similar to the ones in Java, including but not limited to: dot operators, (string) literals, and methods.

- After running app.py:


- Http link was generated. When pasted into browser, shows a webpage with the printed words "No hablo queso!" (from the return statement).


- "__main__" was output in terminal later (from the print statement).


- Was necessary to switch server to that of a development one rather than production. Added some lines to the python file as well as installed waitress package from terminal.
