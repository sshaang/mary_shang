DEFINITIONS:
MongoDB is a NoSQL database which stores your data in an organized way
but not in rows and columns

Collection: an organized store of documents in MongoDB usually with common fields between documents.
             There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.

Document: a way to organize and store data as a set of field-value pairs

Field: a unique identifier for a datapoint

Value: data related to a given identifier

Replica Set: a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure that
a             Comes from the word replicate - to copy something.

Instance: a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software,
in our case it is the MongoDB database.

Cluster: group of servers that store your data.

NOTES:
The MongoDB Database
- a database is a structured way to store and acess data
- A NoSQL databse: related tables of data
- NoSQL documentDB: data in MongoDB is stored as documents
- Documents are store in collections of documents

Atlas manages details of creating clusters for you which runs and maintains databse
deployment. This includes cloud service providers of your own choosing.

2 ways to interact with cluster:
1. Data Explorer by clicking the collections button which displays databass and collections
   that you have in your cluster
2. Shell by clicking the connect button

In-browser IDE: a space where you can practice what you learned

QUESTIONS:
How does operations and logical size increase?
