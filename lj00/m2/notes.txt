To connect to the Atlas cluster:
mongo "mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/admin"

JSON vs BSON
MongoDB stores data in BSON, internally and over the network,
and you can then view it in JSON.

- if exporting to a different system, better to export as BSON than JSON
- if exporting to a local systEM, JSON is better

JSON FORMAT:
- starts and end {}
- key and values are separated by :
- each key-value pair is separated by
- keys are surrounded by ""
- keys interchangeable with fields
- can be natively stored and retrieved in MongoDB

JSON PROS
- user-friendly
- readable
- familiar

JSON CONS
- text-based, slow to read
- space-consuming
- support limited number of datatypes

BSON (binary JSON)
- optimized for speed, space and flexibility
- supports a bigger range of datatypes
- faster to parse
- lighter to store
- provides additional features like speed and flexibility

URI string (unifrom Resource Identifier)
SRV connection string - a specific format used to establish a connection
                        between your application and a MongoDB instance

JSON
mongoimport --uri="mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your
                   cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies" --drop <file>.json
            - uses --uri "<Atlas Cluster URL>"
            - --drop <file>.json

mongoexport --uri="mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your
                   cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies" --collection=sales --out=<file>.json
            - uses --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"
            	       --collection=<collection>
            	       --out=<filename>.json


BSON
mongodump --uri "mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your
                 cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies"
          --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"

mongorestore --uri "mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your
                    cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies"  --drop dump
             --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"
             --drop dump

Data Explorer
- uses Atla UI
- go to Data Explorer by clicking 'Collections
- on the left will be a bunch of databases; click the one needed
- use Search Bar for specific queries uses field-values, can use multiple

Namespace
- The concatenation of the database name and collection name is called a namespace.

COMMANDS:
$ show dbs
shows the list of databases that are in the cluster
can see the admin and local databases

$ use sample_training
- like cd except into Namespace

$ show collections
- shows the collections in the UI

$ db.<collection_name>.find(<query>)
- finds documents that have the query^ in them

$ db.<collection_name>.find()
- first 20 documents are presented to you in no particular order

$db.<collection name>.find(<query>).count()
- counts how many collections have query

$db.<collection name>.find(<query>).pretty()
- returns the documents that match the given query formatted for ease of reading

$ it
- similar to more/less command in Terminal
- iterates through a cursor
- cursor is a pointer to a result set of a query
- pointer is a direct address to a memory location
