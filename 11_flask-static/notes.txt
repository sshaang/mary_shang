K11: Some Things Never Change

app.py and the static folder are in the same directory.

Within the static folder, there are two files named foo.
One is a HTML type document (and has html embeding) while the
other's file type is simply listed as "File". 

We predicted that if we accessed http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html
the webpage would load the text "this here some plaintext tho" properly.
We predicted that if we tried to access http://localhost:5000/static/foo,
the webpage would not load.

When we loaded http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html the webpage did load
with the text "this here some plaintext tho" (If you inspect-elemented,
the html was exactly the same as the file). When we tried to load
http://localhost:5000/static/foo, the foo file was downloaded from the
browser.
