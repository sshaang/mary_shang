K12 -- ...or The Only Constant is Change?
2020-10-15

app.py and the templates folder are in the same directory.

Within the templates folder, there is one HTML file named model_tmplt.

We predicted that if we accessed http://localhost:5000/,
the webpage would load "No hablo queso!".
If we accessed http://localhost:5000/my_foist_template
the webpage would print the elements in coll with linebreaks.

After running app.py, we found that what we predicted was right.

Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line?
We are still able to access http://localhost:5000/, but when we try to access
http://localhost:5000/my_foist_template, it returns a NameError, saying
name 'render_template' is not defined.

Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
Yes, it should be http://localhost:5000/my_foist_template.

Q2: What is the significance of each argument?
'model_tmplt.html' is the file containing the template that is to be rendered;
foo is the variable in model_tmplt representing the title of the webpage, and
foo="fooooo" sets the title name to "fooooo";
collection is a variable in the model_tmplt.html file, and collection=coll sets
its value to coll, a list of integers in app.py.
