Other than using DictReader in the csv module to convert the csv file to a 
dictionary, we can also read the file in python by using open() and build a 
dictionary from there. But the downside of this is that we have to strip the 
first and last lines of the csv file and deal with all the commas.


A great way to randomly select a weighted occupation is to use random.choices(). 
After creating a list of occupations and a list of percentages, 
random.choice(sequence, weights=<weights>, k=<num>) allows us to randomly 
select an element from sequence (the list of occupations) based on weights 
(the list of percentages). k indicates the length of the returned list, 
and in this case, it's 1 because we are only picking one occupation.


It is helpful to put the step-by-step plans/approaches to solving an assignment
problem at the top of the homework file so that we can always refer to them
when coding and keep ourselves on track.
