$ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero


Prompts Python to -m(ake) a venv (virtual environment) of Python3 (Python version 3)
as a directory called "myherozero" with subsequent directories inside it containing
supporting files.


Virtual environments are used to run modules in a specific version of Python. 
Without them, it would not be possible to run two different modules with different
requirements with the same Python installation.
